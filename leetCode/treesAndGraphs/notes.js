/*

Pre-order Traversal: root ==> left ==> right

In-order Traversal : left ==> root ==> right (can retrieve all data in sorted order)

Post-order Traversal : left ==> right ==> root (delete order - i.e. delete a nodes lefts childe and right child before deleting self)
    - also used in mathematical expressions as it's easier to write this way
